Now that the first project is well underway, this class is starting to pick up.

Sadly, I had to be absent from Monday's class because [my band](http://www.the-returners.com) had just performed at [PAX](http://prime.paxsite.com/) the night before in Seattle. Even though I only skipped one 50-minute lecture, it surprised me how much information I missed out on. I'm pretty sure I missed some discussion about [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/), which is unfortunate because continuous integration is a brand-new concept to me. Reading a little more about it on my own and using Travis CI while working on my project, my general impression is good. For one thing, I like the way a CI client will automatically run unit tests on every single build. I also think it encourages programmers to commit more frequently, which additionally encourages one to try to add features and approach debugging in small, discrete chunks that have less risk of breaking everything. This is complementary to [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), which I'm sure is something we'll discuss in more detail later in this class.

As an aside, and related to the continous deployment aspect of CI, I will say that even though it's not a bad thing to update software frequently (especially bug fixes), I think the update experience for end users needs to be severely improved in most programs. For instance, it's hard to express how annoying it is to be prompted to update my computer mouse's software every single week - an action that disables the mouse briefly and then requires a restart - when I have never had any problems with it or thought, "Hmm, this could use a new feature!" Maybe it's because the bugs are getting fixed before I have a chance to find them, but boy would it be nice if it just downloaded those updates in the background and installed them the next time I restarted.

Another discussion I may have missed was that of feature tagging, because when I got to that step in the Collatz project I had to go do some more internet research. I found [this GCC article](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Ifdef.html) helpful, as well as [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21256302) on Stack Overflow. Hopefully others will also find them useful.

**Tip of the Week**: Jeff Atwood, the founder of Stack Overflow, hosts [one of my favorite programming blogs](http://blog.codinghorror.com). Probably most of you have read an article on there at some point in your internet travels. As someone who very frequently types at a computer keyboard, plays a musical keyboard, and sews - among all the other daily tasks I do with my hands - I sometimes suffer from tendonitis and some pretty excruciating hand pain. So before you become old like me, do yourself a favor and [start exercising](http://blog.codinghorror.com/programming-your-hands/).
