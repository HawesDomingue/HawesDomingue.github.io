title: "Week 13: Group Project Wrap-Up"

*What did you do this past week?*

On Thursday night, the final phase of our group's project was due. I'm relieved to have it out of the way, but I'm walking away from this project with a lot of disappointment. Our team was made up of five people who lived very far away from each other and had busy schedules, so nearly all of our collaboration was via Slack and Skype. Since I'm the only team member in the 1:00 p.m. section, there are actually two team members I have yet to meet in person. I ended up spending most of the project cleaning up our data sources and doing very little coding outside of making Python scripts to accomplish said data cleanup. I did learn some SQLAlchemy before the end, which was the part I was most interested in, but most of that back-end work was done by one of my teammates while I was busy getting our database in order. So I don't feel like I learned much from this project at all. Except maybe about food, since our project is about recipes. I can tell you all about the stuff in the grocery store now.

*What's in your way?*

Surviving the last quizzes, the presentation (which I'm not too worried about), and the second exam (which I am very worried about).

*What will you do next week?*

Finish critiques and the presentation. Our team is already about halfway there, and I'm pretty good at PowerPoint, so no problem.
