This class ends on somewhat of a low note for me, since I'm pretty sure I didn't do too well on the last test. It didn't come as a surprise, since I made the sleep-deprived decision to invest most of my schoolwork time to an end-of-the-year team project in another class instead of studying for this one. However, my team in that other class did win a scholarship for our project, which means that I can now afford to pay my tuition for my final semester. So while I have some regret for not devoting more time to OOP, which was genuinely interesting to me, in the end it was probably worth not going into more debt to get a lower grade in this class. Sometimes you have to lose some to win some.

I have one more semester ahead of me before graduating, and because I am crazy, I am taking Software Engineering to finish out the trifecta of Glenn Downing's UT courses. I've heard that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is taught in that course; since I actually learned some Python recently to do scripting work for the aforementioned team project, I'm excited to learn more. It does use [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), which still looks weird to me. One thing I can tell you is that it accomplishes I/O and parsing tasks way more simply than C++ or Java. I should've learned it when I was trying to do some competitive programming earlier in the semester, but now I know.

Final thoughts on this course: 
  - Working with a partner is easier than working on a large team, but also easier than working solo. 
  - Continuous integration is a neat tool and looks like it will start becoming a standard going forward. 
  - Unit tests should be graded on quality (code coverage), not quantity.
  - Version control is your friend. 

Anyway, since all of my courses decided to not have finals, this blog post happens to be the very last thing I have to do for the semester. So I have some feelings. Exhaustion from lack of sleep and lack of doing anything during my waking hours besides work, school, and feeding myself. Excitement for being able to do fun things tonight instead of working on projects or studying. Regret for not doing better on the test. But mostly relief that I can sleep in tomorrow morning.

**Tip of the Week**: I've mentioned [Jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) here before for parsing tasks, but now that I've been learning Python for these things, I highly recommend Jsoup's cousin, [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). Parse your HTML and XML documents with ease!
