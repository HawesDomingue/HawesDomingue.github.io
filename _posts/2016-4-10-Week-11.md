title: "Week 11: Sleep is for the sane"
---

Holy moly, it's Sunday evening and I almost forgot to do my blog post.

*What did you do this past week?*

Last week was probably the lowest point of my whole semester. I was really disappointed about getting a 0 on Monday's quiz, because even though I know regexes pretty well, the *one* thing I forgot was that groups get indexed starting at 1 instead of 0 in Python regex (the 0th group is the entire match). So that got me the wrong answer for every single question, even though I understood the rest of the syntax. Then all week I was trying desperately to do as much as I could to help on phase 2 of the project and just doing a terrible job of it while not getting enough sleep. I did go to the [College Puzzle Challenge](https://www.collegepuzzlechallenge.com/) yesterday though, and that was a lot of fun.

*What's in your way?*

My mental well-being. In addition to not getting enough sleep, I haven't been doing my regular physical exercise routine and my diet has been awful. I really need to back up from the computer for a little bit every day and take care of my basic needs.

*What will you do next week?*

I didn't manage to finish getting all the data we need for the database done, and I have a terrible setup on my computer for working with the database. I aim to fix that ASAP so I can be more efficient and useful in the last, final push for phase 3.

**Tip of the Week**: In addition to puzzles, I also enjoy solving math and programming problems. My boyfriend recently introduced me to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), which is similar to [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/) in the large variety of mathematical and algorithmic problems available to solve. It's a fun way to practice programming in the two new languages I'm learning this semester - Haskell and Python. Unlike SPOJ, however, Project Euler doesn't require that you submit code - you need only to submit the correct answer. In certain respects I like this option, because sometimes solving a problem on SPOJ makes you have to [reinvent the wheel](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/29524). Is it really worth my time to write a method to find primes when there is a Python library that will do so [much more efficiently](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gmpy/)? I think these are relevant things to consider when you go to work for a company that doesn't want just people who are clever, but people who can quickly deliver products. Spending time on a small problem to make a bigger project work, when someone somewhere else has already spent the time to resolve that problem and made it available for you to use, is a waste of you and your company's time and resources.
